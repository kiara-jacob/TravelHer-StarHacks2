## Inspiration
As young women who love to travel, we are constantly reminded of the dangers of traveling alone. This has often led to fun and carefree vacations being turned into stressful trips, filled with worry and fear of new dangers in new environments. Being from different parts of the world we realised the struggle is always the same. 
Lack of helpful resources and support are the main reasons why 63%  of women think about safety while travelling. 

**TravelHer is designed to be _the_ resource you need when travelling!**

## What it does?
TravelHer aims to create a safe and flexible space and community for women who love to travel. We provide resources and information that can help guide women in making the safest possible travel plans and routes.

Already planned a trip and need safety tips to be prepared for the worst? Our _Safety Information_ tab is your one stop shop for self-defence tips and advice!
Planning on traveling to another continent? Our _International Star Rating List_ allows you to view the overall safety of a location compared to others so you know what you're getting into.
Not sure where to go and want some ideas? Head over to _Locations_ for our recommendations spanning several continents!
_Emergency Contacts_ has helpline information for different countries so you can get the help you need ASAP!
Had an unforgettable experience during your trip? Share it with us (anonymously ofcourse!) in the _Share Your Story_ corner so women all over the world can learn from your experience and be prepared.

**Our goal at the end of the day is to empower women to take their travel plans into their owns hands so they can connect and collaborate with others and explore the world on their own terms.**

## How we built it?
TravelHer is built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and hosted on replit.

## Challenges we ran into
One of our biggest challenges was the actual design and look of the website. While we all had experience with HTML, its implementation with CSS and JavaScript meant dealing with a steep learning curve. The process of converting our ideas into something tangible was also something we struggled with. Figuring out which ideas could be accomplished in the given timeframe was another challenge we faced.

## Accomplishments we're proud of
Despite being spread across 3 different timezones we managed to build and pitch TravelHer in the given timeframe. We are extremely proud of TravelHer and what it stands for. Building connections and empowering women is something important to all 4 of us and we feel TravelHer has helped us accomplish that.

## What we learned
When we first set out to build **TravelHer** we had never expected to learn so much. We overcame coordinating different tasks among our different timezones, lack of knowledge of CSS and JavaScript syntax and various design flaws. We managed to launch a fully functioning website that we hope is a resource to empower women all over the globe.

## What's next for TravelHer?
StarHacks has given us a platform to come together and proudly say we built something but this is just the beginning for what we hope to achieve with TravelHer. We hope to expand some of our existing features which include building a database of shared experiences from women all over the world and an expanded list of countries and their landmarks. With time we also want to make our site fully optimised for usage on other devices. 

We have so many ideas that we hope to implement and TravelHer's journey is just beginning!

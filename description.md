As young women ourselves, who love to travel, we are constantly reminded of the dangers of traveling. This has often led to fun and carefree vacations being turned into stressful trips filled with worry and fear of new dangers in new environments. Being from different parts of the world we realised the struggle is the same. Lack of helpful resources and support are the main reasons why 63% of women think about safety while travelling.

TravelHer is designed to be the resource you need when travelling!

TravelHer aims to create a safe and flexible space and community for women who love to travel. We provide resources and information that can help guide women in making the safest possible travel plans and routes. Already planned a trip and need safety tips to be prepared for the worst? Our Safety Information tab is your one stop shop for all tips and advice! Planning on traveling to another continent? With our International Star Rating List that allows you to view the overall safety of that location compared to others so you know what you're getting into! Not sure where to go and want some ideas? Head over to Places for our recommendations spanning all the several locations! Emergency Contacts has helpline information for several countries so you can get the help you need ASAP! Had an unforgettable experience during your trip? Share it with us (anonymously ofcourse!) in the Share Your Story corner so women all over the world can learn from your experience and be prepared! Our goal at the end of the day is to empower women to take their travel plans into their owns hands so they can connect and collaborate with others and explore the world on their own terms.

TravelHer is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Our website is built and hosted on replit.

One of our biggest challenges was the actual design and look of the website. While we all had experience with HTML, its implementation with CSS and JavaScript meant we had a big learning curve. The process of converting our ideas into something tangible was also something we struggled with. Figuring out which ideas could be accomplished in the given timeframe was a challenge.

Despite being spread across 3 different timezones we managed to build and pitch TravelHer in the given timeframe.We are extremely proud of TravelHer and what it stands for. Building connections and empowering women is something important to all 4 of us and we feel TravelHer has helped us accomplish that.

When we first set out to build TravelHer we had never expected to learn so much. We overcame coordinating different tasks in different timezones, lack of knowledge of CSS and JavaScript syntax and various design flaws. We have managed to build a fully functioning website that we hope is a resource to empower women all over the globe.

StarHacks has given us a platform to come together and proudly say we built something but this is just the beginning for TravelHer. We hope to expand some of our existing features which include building a database of shared experiences from women all over the world and an expanded list of countries and their landmarks. With time we also want to make our site fully optimised for mobile usage. We hope to build a system that gets user input to determine the safety and location of an area. We have so many ideas that we hope to implement with time! TravelHer's journey is just beginning!
